This website is called Antonio's Cafe, a food and fine dinning resturant.  
I use css flexbox to control the navagation items and logo in the header banner as well as control and organize the content and images in the about, menu and contact sections of the webpage. Media queries are used to control the layout and content for large, medium and mobile sizes.
When the hamburger icon is displayed and clicked on in mobile veiw I use javascript as well as css to display on and off the nav items as well as the waiter svg image icon.
I use a javascript Multidimensional Array to populate the food menu on the web page.
I use javascript to calulate and populate the store offer on the food menu on the web page.
I use javascript to control an automatic image slide show for the main and menu pictures.
I use javascript to style two of the contact form input fields name and date turning them lightgrey.
